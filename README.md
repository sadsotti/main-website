# My Main Website ‚Äì Lorenzo Sottile

This repository contains the source code of my main personal website. I am a Developer & IT Consultant specialized in web development, digital advertising, video making, and 3D modeling for real estate. The website is designed to showcase my projects, services, r√©sum√©, and provide a way to get in touch. 

**The website is entirely in Italian, as it serves as a business card for clients based in Italy, where I live.**

## üöÄ Project Overview

* **Curriculum Vitae:** A detailed section on my professional background, including experience as IT Consultant and ICT Developer, technical skills, education, and certifications (e.g., Java Junior Developer course, Google Analytics Advanced).
* **Contact Me:** A contact form to facilitate communication and requests.
* **Privacy Policy & Cookies:** Information about privacy management, cookie usage, and links to external sites.

## üìß Contact Form Setup (Optional)

The contact form in `contattami.html` is currently configured to display a ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù message on the client side when submitted. If you'd like the form to actually send emails, you‚Äôll need to integrate a third-party service (e.g., EmailJS, Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.).

* **Example with EmailJS:**
    If you decide to use EmailJS in the future, you'll need to:
    1.  Create an account on [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).
    2.  Obtain your **Public Key** from your EmailJS account.
    3.  Configure a **Service ID** and **Template ID** in your account.
    4.  Update your JavaScript code (probably in the script inside `contattami.html` or an external `main.js` file) with these credentials, following EmailJS documentation.
